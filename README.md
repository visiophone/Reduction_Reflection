# Reduction_Reflection
code for Reduction-Reflection

Video commissioned by the record label Cronica, for the track "118(Reduction/Reflection)” from "Three-Body Problem” album by @C.
Audio-reactive graphics, rendered in realtime on Processing. A group of particles are driven by a flow-field that reacts to sound's amplitude. Along the track the particles move around the screen with unpredictable paths generated by the sound inputs on the flow-field. Different types of visualizations are explored: the particles, the flow-field, and Voronoi cells created by the particles’ positions.

Created in Processing and recorder with Syphon.Needs Mesh library by Lee Byron http://leebyron.com/mesh/
Works on Processing 3.0.1

Code build over the "Flow Field" example by Daniel Shiffman on "The Nature of Code"
