# Reduction_Reflection
code for Reduction-Reflection

Video commissioned by the record label Cronica, for the track "118(Reduction/Reflection)” from "Three-Body Problem” album by @C.

Audio-reactive graphics, rendered in real-time on Processing. A group of particles are driven by a flow-field that reacts to sound's amplitude. Along the track the particles move around the screen with unpredictable paths generated by the sound inputs on the flow-field. Different types of visualizations are explored: the particles, the flow-field, and Voronoi cells created by the particles’ positions.

Created in Processing (works on v3), captured and recorder with Syphon. Voronoi cells made with Mesh library by Lee Byron.

Inspired by: The "Nature of Code” by Daniel Shiffman (in fact this project started over the code example “FlowField” on chapter 6); ++ The amazing recent work of Raven Know with Voronoi, Particles, and other weird moving things.
